If this is what you're planning to do this year, you'll have to motivate to burn your piece.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>You don't have to burn your piece. You might think that burning it is an easy way to get rid of it (and not transport it back) - it's not: you'd still have to clean up the burn site and remove all coals, rebar etc. </span><br />\r\n<span>So consider whether burning is important to the meaning of your piece carefully. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>We love works that can be used outside of the event again, whether as ‘permanent’ installations in an urban space or at Decompression, <a href=\"www.streetopia.co.za\" target=\"_blank\">Streetopia</a>, Maker Faire etc.</span><span> Also, please consider designing your project in such a way that it can be dismantled and re-purposed. You can donate your good materials to Outreach projects. (This just needs to be arranged in advance before the event.)</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>If it's really important for your artwork to burn, consider that in your design - and remember you're building a fire and that has to be considered in your design. The Art Committee will assess your request to burn your piece based on your motivation and design.</span></p>\r\n"
