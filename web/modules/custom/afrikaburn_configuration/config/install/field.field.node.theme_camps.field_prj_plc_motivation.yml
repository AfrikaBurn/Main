description: "Space on Binnekring Road and 10ish Boulevarde is in great demand - and it comes with the obligation of being a Public Engagement Space. Please give us a brief motivation as to why your camp would benefit the community by being placed in theses areas of frontage. <br>\r\nNote: your camp does not get Binnekring placement automatically by filling in this form. <br>\r\nTheme Camps must be visually stimulating and interactive, and should include activities, events or services to the community in general. <br>\r\nCheck out our <a href=\"/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Theme-Camp-Placement-Guidelines-2015.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Theme Camp Placement Guidelines</a> here."
