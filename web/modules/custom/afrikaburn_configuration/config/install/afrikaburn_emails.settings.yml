gr_create_0: "Hello you mighty brave applicant,\r\n\r\nThank you, we have received your Creative Grant Application.\r\n\r\nEvery year we get loads of grant applications, requesting funding totaling many times the value of the AfrikaBurn creative grant pot. Experience has shown that it is important not to spread the grant pot too thin, but rather to make a meaningful contribution to a smaller amount of projects. This means that many grant applications will not get funding.\r\n\r\nCreative Grants are intended to support projects by alleviating some of the financial responsibility. All applicants should expect to carry some of the financial responsibility for their project themselves.\r\n\r\nIf you do not get awarded a creative grant for your project, it does not mean that you cannot bring your project to Tankwa Town - You can and we will help you in any other way we can. So please start thinking now about how else you could secure assistance or support for your project.\r\nHere’s some ideas [Insert link].\r\n\r\nWhat happens next?\r\nWe will be accepting  creative grant applications till the end of October. Once this window has closed, the assessment process will start in early November. As an applicant you will be invited to participate in the initial part of the assessment process.\r\nPlease read more about the Creative Grant Assessment Process [Insert link].\r\n\r\nDuring the assessment process (through November) we need you to keep a keen eye on your inbox as we might have clarification questions for around aspects of your project and your prompt reply could be the difference between getting funding or not. Its also of the utmost importance for a timely outcome of the grant process.\r\n\r\nWe are aiming to have the process concluded by the end of November.\r\nIn the case that your project has been awarded funding, you will have a week to accept the grant for the time that we have notified you of the outcome.\r\nIf you do not respond within that time, the funds awarded to your project will be re-allocated to another project on the waiting list.\r\n\r\nWe are aiming to have the grant process concluded by mid December.  This is tight, but it is possible, and it will help you actualise your project without breaking yourself and your crew - Time is your friend, especially when you’re working with limited funds.\r\nPlease help us to get this right!\r\n\r\nThank you for helping to make Tankwa Town that place that we all love!\r\n\r\nWishing you all the best,\r\nthe AfrikaBurn Art Committee"
