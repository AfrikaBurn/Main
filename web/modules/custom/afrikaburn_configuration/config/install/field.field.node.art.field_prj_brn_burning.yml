description: "<p><b>Note that this year burning artworks need to be approved by the Art Committee and the Pyro Team, based on your motivation, design and burn plan.</b></p>\r\n<p>Remember that you don't have to burn your piece. We love works that can be used outside of the event, in public spaces and at other events (Decompression, Streetopia, Maker-Faire, etc.); or which materials can be re-purposed (Outreach Projects, other artworks, etc)</p>\r\n<p><b>Please consider carefully whether burning is important to the meaning of your piece. </b></p>"
