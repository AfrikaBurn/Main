If this is what you are planning to do, this year, you will have to motivate to burn your piece.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Remember that you don't have to burn your piece. You might think that burning it is an easy way to get rid of it (and not transport it back) - it's not: you'd still have to clean up the burn site and remove all coals, rebar etc.<br />\r\nConsider carefully whether burning is important to the meaning of your piece.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We love works that can be used outside of the event again, whether as ‘permanent’ installations in an urban space or at Decompression, Streetopia, Maker Faire etc.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Also, please consider designing your project in such a way that it can be dismantled and re-purposed. You can donate your good materials to Outreach projects. (This will have to be arranged in advance before the event.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If it is really important for your artwork to burn, please consider that in your design - Remember that you are building a fire and that has to be considered in your design.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Art Committee and the Pyro Team will assess your request to burn your piece based on your motivation and design.</p>\r\n"
