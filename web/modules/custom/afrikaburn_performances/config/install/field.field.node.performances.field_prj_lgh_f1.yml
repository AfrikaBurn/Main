Lighting protects your performance space from accidental damage, and from accidentally damaging someone or something in the dark. You can go all out with parcans and a generator, or go green with solar power, go low-tech with candles in jars, or anything in between. We do, of course, love renewables more and they are good investments. </span></p>\r\n"
